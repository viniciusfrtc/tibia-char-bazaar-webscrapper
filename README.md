# tibia-char-bazaar-webscrapper

This was a project regarding an online game called Tibia which has a auction system in its website for game characters. 

I made at first the scrapping/parsing of the auctions list page (which shows several auctions at the same time),
parsing its data and saving into mongodb. I made this way in order to have all auction ids (they expire from the auction list 
view in one month but still could be accessible after that if I had its id).
